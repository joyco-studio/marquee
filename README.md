## ❗️ MUST DO ON TEMPLATE FORK ❗️

This template has sample data by default. So run the setup script as soon as you fork & clone.

```bash
pnpm setup:template
```

This will fill package information and install deps for you. Remember to commit.

> If you enable PR & commit package preview you need to install [PKG.PR.NEW](https://github.com/apps/pkg-pr-new) on the target repository.

### `package.json` defaults

- `author: joyco.studio`
- `publishConfig.access: private`
- `version: 0.0.0`
- `license: ISC`

## 👀 Good to know

If you **DON't** need react as a peer dependency you **NEED** to delete it.

```bash
# 1. Remove both the devDependencies and peerDependencies
pnpm remove @types/react react
```

Then **manually** remove the peerDependencies section from `package.json` and also check `eslint.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`.

## 🤖 Automatic Workflows

This template comes with two GitHub Actions workflows (currently disabled for convenience):

1. **Release Workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml.disabled`): Automates the release process using Changesets. When enabled, it will automatically create release pull requests and publish to npm when changes are pushed to the main branch.

2. **Publish Any Commit** (`.github/workflows/publish-any-commit.yml.disabled`): A utility workflow that can build and publish packages for any commit or pull request.

To enable these workflows, simply remove the `.disabled` extension from the workflow files in the `.github/workflows/` directory. We recommend enabling them to automate your package's release process.

## 🦋 Version Management

This library uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions and publish releases. Here's how to use it:

### Adding a changeset

When you make changes that need to be released:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select which packages you want to include in the changeset
2. Choose whether it's a major/minor/patch bump
3. Provide a summary of the changes

### Creating a release

To create a new version and update the changelog:

```bash
# 1. Create new versions of packages
pnpm version:package

# 2. Release (builds and publishes to npm)
pnpm release
```

Remember to commit all changes after creating a release.
